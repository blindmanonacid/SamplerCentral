# SamplerCentral

SamplerCentral is a sound performance tool designed for live theater using MIDI keyboards. It is in many ways the anti-thesis to QLab. The idea is to have as much room to improvise as possible and to be able to control anything (sounds, lights, motors, robots etc) with the push of a midi key.

It has been developed since 2010 for my personal work but as I keep sharing it with others that I work with it now the documentation is more or less complete and anyone should be able to understand how it works.

At the moment it is MacOS only, does not yet work on the newer M1/M2 macs as I don't have one to develop on. There will be a Windows version coming.

It supports Open Sound Control (OSC), DMX (with Enttec USBPro) and ETC midi protocol. More will be added in the future.
