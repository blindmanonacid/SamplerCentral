- Be sure that in "Audio Midi Settings" in MacOS the sample rate is set to 48000 on both input and output. Sometimes other DAW apps will mess with this, If SamplerCentral complains that audio input and output doesn't match, check Audio Midi Settings" in MacOS, if it says 48000 on both microphone and output you should be able to re-start SamplerCentral and it should work. It could also be in your soundcard settings depending on the soundcard you use.\
